Exercises from Felleisen &amp; Friedman's "The Seasoned Schemer"

Environment is Dr Racket. I am starting out with #lang racket; we'll see if that's OK or if we need to switch to R^5RS. Only definitions captured here - most of the book is Q&A which happens in the REPL.

Also note this book is Part 2 of The Little Schemer, and starts with Chapter 11. See https://github.com/josh-reynolds/TLS.
